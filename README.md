# WeDo2-BLE-Protocol
Study of the LEGO WeDo 2 BLE protocol at the byte level.

This was carried out using a BLED112 dongle, however the data can be used
in any app that can write byte data to a UUID.

The official SDK is at 
https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/wedo-2/developer-kits

However sometimes its just easier to write  a few bytes directly to a UUID!

Hope it's of some use in your project.
